## 🔴 Critical Findings (5 Bugs)

### 1. Volume Surge Calculation (CRITICAL)
- **Bug:** Uses `mean()` instead of `median()` for baseline
- **Impact:** Outliers distort surge detection → false signals
- **Fix:** Patch 001 — Change to `np.median()` in 2 locations
- **Effort:** 5 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Patch ready

### 2. Execution Depth Guard Missing (CRITICAL)
- **Bug:** No validation that order ≤ max_depth_fraction * liquidity
- **Impact:** High slippage, market impact, failed orders
- **Fix:** Patch 002 — Add depth check before execution
- **Effort:** 30 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Patch ready

### 3. Level min_touches Not Enforced (HIGH)
- **Bug:** Levels with 1-2 touches pass validation
- **Impact:** Weak levels generate poor quality signals
- **Fix:** Patch 003 — Add touch count check in validation
- **Effort:** 10 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Patch ready

### 4. No Correlation ID Tracking (HIGH)
- **Bug:** Events not linked (broken data lineage)
- **Impact:** Can't trace signal/order back to source data
- **Fix:** Patch 004 — Add correlation_id throughout pipeline
- **Effort:** 45 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Patch ready

### 5. OI Filter Rejects Spot Markets (MEDIUM)
- **Bug:** Spot symbols get OI=0, fail filter
- **Impact:** Spot markets never scanned
- **Fix:** Patch 005 — Skip OI filter for spot markets
- **Effort:** 20 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Patch ready

**Total fix effort:** ~2 hours

## 📊 Data Quality Assessment

**Test Parameters:**
- Symbols: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, ARB/USDT, PEPE/USDT
- Window: 48 hours
- Timeframe: 15m

### DQA Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Completeness** | 8.5/10 | 2-3% gaps (exchange downtime) |
| **Freshness** | 9.0/10 | WS p95 latency: 350ms (good) |
| **Uniqueness** | 10/10 | No duplicates detected |
| **Consistency** | 7.5/10 | Minor volume mismatches (±5-10%) |
| **Stability** | 7.0/10 | 1-2 teleports per symbol per 48h |
| **Overall** | **8.0/10** | ✅ **Production-grade** |

**Key Issues:**
- OHLCV gaps during exchange maintenance windows (acceptable)
- Rare "teleport" bars (range > 5×ATR) — likely flash crashes
- Volume mismatch between OHLCV and trades (aggregation differences)

**Recommendations:**
- Add OHLCV gap interpolation
- Alert on teleport bars
- Monitor WS reconnection frequency

## 🗺️ Data Lineage Map

**Critical metrics tracked from source to usage:**

| Metric | Source | Window | Quality | Used By |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| `trades_per_minute` | WS trades | 60s rolling | ⚠️ REST fallback | Scanner, Scorer |
| `spread_bps` | WS orderbook | Real-time | ✅ Checksum | Scanner, Execution |
| `depth_0_3pct` | WS orderbook | ±0.3% from mid | ✅ Valid | Scanner, Execution |
| `ATR (15m)` | OHLCV REST | 14 periods | ⚠️ No TZ check | Scanner, Signals |
| `volume_surge` | OHLCV REST | Median(20 bars) | 🔴 **Bug: mean** | Scanner, Scorer |
| `OI delta` | REST futures | 24h | ❌ **No spot check** | Scanner (optional) |
| `btc_correlation` | OHLCV REST | 15m window | ⚠️ Min length 15 | Scanner, Scorer |
| `trading_levels` | OHLCV REST | Donchian+swings | 🔴 **Bug: min_touches** | Signals |
| `l2_imbalance` | WS orderbook | Real-time | ✅ Good | Signals |
| `position_size` | Risk calc | R% * capital | ❌ **No max check** | Execution |

**Gaps identified:**
- No correlation_id linking events (fixed in Patch 004)
- trades_per_minute falls back to REST (should use WS)
- OI not validated for spot markets (fixed in Patch 005)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Action Plan)

### Immediate (Today — 2 hours)
1. ✅ Review all patches (`patches/00*.diff`)
2. ✅ Apply patches (manual or `git apply`)
3. ✅ Run tests: `pytest -q tests/diag_*.py`
4. ✅ Verify fixes: `python verify_fixes.py`

### Short-term (This Week)
5. Run 24-hour paper trading test
6. Monitor scanner output (should see 3-8 candidates)
7. Validate signal generation (should see 1+ per hour in active markets)
8. Review trace logs for data flow

### Medium-term (Next Sprint)
9. Implement near-miss logging (visibility into failed conditions)
10. Add weighted signal scoring (vs. strict AND gates)
11. Relax BTC correlation filter (or remove)
12. Build trace analysis dashboard

### Long-term (Roadmap)
13. Automated DQA cron job (daily reports)
14. Percentile-based volume filters (vs. static thresholds)
15. ATR-based epsilon (vs. percentage)
16. Real-time anomaly detection (teleports, spikes)
